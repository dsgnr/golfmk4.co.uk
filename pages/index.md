## Welcome!

This website has been created to house an assortment of helpful information that I've collected 
throughout my Volkswagen Golf MK4 ownership. If you're here, you know that DIY guides and 
part numbers, can be found over the internet. Some of these pages have broken images 
and others lead to nowhere. This site is designed to be open-source and stored on 
[GitHub]({{ site.repo }}){:target="_blank"}, meaning anyone can contribute if they feel inclined.

I do not claim ownership, or origin of the data provided on this site, unless otherwise stated.

<strong>All information provided on this site is to be used at your own risk. 
No liability or responsibility can be taken for anything obtained from this site. 
The information provided here is purely for friendly sharing amongst the community.</strong>
